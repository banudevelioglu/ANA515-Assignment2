## Section 1: Description of the Data

The dataset used for this analysis is the "biden_score_2023.xlsx" file. It contains information about legislators, their party affiliation, agreement percentage with Biden, and the margin of votes for Biden in their district.

## Section 2: Reading the Data into R

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Provide the correct file path
file_path <- "C:/Users/BanuD/Documents/biden_score_2023.xlsx"
data <- read_excel(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
head(data)

# Clean the data: rename columns for clarity, if necessary, and ensure proper data types
data <- data %>%
  rename(
    BioGuide = bioguide,
    Name = name,
    Chamber = chamber,
    State = state,
    District = district,
    Party = party,
    AgreePct = agree_pct,
    BidenMargin = biden_margin
  )

# Convert any necessary columns to appropriate data types
data$AgreePct <- as.numeric(data$AgreePct)
data$BidenMargin <- as.numeric(data$BidenMargin)

# Display the structure of the cleaned dataframe
